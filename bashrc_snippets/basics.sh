# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them into .bashrc directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.
# add these lines to .bashrc to do so:

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
